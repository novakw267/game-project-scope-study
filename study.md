## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
-   How you plan to approach this project.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.

I am not entirely sure about the data structure, I will probably try keep a tally of each players score in a string.

I was to represent the board in a grid pattern or 3x3 but have tiles that spin around instead of flip over if possible. I would also like to use different images instead of x's and o's. Maybe an iconic villian and hero, maybe puppies?

My plan of attack to set this game up is to prepair the structure as a framework. I will then attempt to add the functions and interaction in around that. That way I have a foundation to build off of. After the game itself is working, I was to add the ability to make accounts and be able to sign in and out. This way people can keep track of their record.

I plan on setting up stages after finishing each section of the foundation to start. Then after each little piece of the base game is working. I will also have working save states in between each piece as well, but those will serve as my major markers. 

If I have time I plan on trying to set up the chat system, and maybe a backround that change with each click on the board.
